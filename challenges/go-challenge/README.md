# Docker challenge with go

This repository is the solution to the first full cycle docker course challenge. The idea was to create a hello world in golang and create an image with less than 2MB that contains the hello world

The image can be found at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/luisfelipe998/go-challenge

To run: `docker run luisfelipe998/go-challenge:prod`
