# Docker challenge with node.js + nginx + mysql

This repository is the solution to the second full cycle docker course challenge. The idea was to create a node.js application that communicates with a mysql database and is accessed through nginx as reverse proxy. All container should be orquestrated by a docker-compose.yml file.

To run: `docker-compose up --build` and then access `localhost:8080`
